# Building a Multi-Agent Financial News Analysis System with LangGraphJS

In this guide, we’ll **learn LangGraphJS** fundamentals by **building a multi-agent system** that analyzes financial news and assesses their impact on stocks. LangGraphJS is a graph-based extension of LangChainJS for designing complex LLM-powered workflows. We’ll cover core concepts (nodes, edges, execution flow), integrate key LangChainJS features (LLMs, tools, memory, embeddings), construct a **multi-agent workflow** for news analysis, connect to real-time data (NewsAPI for news, Finnhub for stock info), and set up monitoring and debugging. By following this hands-on, step-by-step tutorial, you’ll gain practical experience with LangGraphJS while creating a simplified financial news analyzer. 

## LangGraphJS Fundamentals: Nodes, Edges, and Execution Flow

LangGraphJS models an AI agent as a **stateful graph** of nodes and edges ([LangGraph Tutorial: Building LLM Agents with LangChain's Agent Framework](https://www.getzep.com/ai-agents/langgraph-tutorial#:~:text=Concept%20Description%20What%20is%20LangGraph%3F,workflows%20with%20cycles%20and%20branches)). **Nodes** represent functions or steps (usually TypeScript async functions) that operate on a shared **state**, and **edges** define the transitions between these nodes. The graph has special start and end nodes (often denoted `START` and `END`) to mark entry and exit points. At runtime, LangGraphJS executes nodes in sequence following the directed edges, passing along the state as it goes. This lets you define complex workflows with branching and looping logic (via conditional edges) rather than a simple linear chain.

- **Nodes**: In LangGraphJS, a node can be any function (sync or async) that takes the current state (and optionally a config object) and returns some output or updated state ([LangGraph.js Concept Guide - DEV Community](https://dev.to/zand/langgraphjs-concept-guide-50g0#:~:text=In%20a%20StateGraph%2C%20Nodes%20are,thread_id)). For example, a node could fetch data, call an API, or invoke an LLM. You add nodes to a graph by giving them a name and the function to execute.  
- **Edges**: Edges connect one node to the next, controlling execution flow. By default, an edge from node A to B means once A finishes, B will run. You can add edges in LangGraphJS with a fluent API (e.g. `graph.addEdge("A", "B")`). Special edge cases include starting the graph (`START -> someNode`) and ending it (node -> `END`). Edges can also be **conditional** – deciding the next node based on state. For instance, you might route to different nodes depending on the result of a node’s output ([Learn the basics](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/tutorials/quickstart/#:~:text=A%20ToolNode%20%20enables%20the,or%20respond%20to%20the%20request)). This conditional routing is key for implementing decision logic in the agent’s workflow.  
- **Execution Flow**: When you invoke a LangGraphJS agent, it initializes the state (e.g. with input data) and then activates the `START` node, following edges through the graph. Each node may update the shared state or produce outputs that later nodes use. The process continues until an edge leads to an `END` node, at which point the final state (containing all accumulated results) is returned. Because the state is shared and carried through, every node can access outputs of previous nodes if needed. This design allows for fine-grained control and even cycles (loops) in logic, ensuring the agent can handle complex sequences reliably.  
- **Debugging Tools**: LangGraphJS provides mechanisms to introspect and debug the graph’s execution. You can visualize the graph structure (for example, by exporting a Mermaid diagram of the nodes and edges) to understand the workflow ([Learn the basics](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/tutorials/quickstart/#:~:text=The%20createReactAgent%20constructor%20lets%20you,visual%20representation%20of%20the%20graph)). During execution, you can log the state at various nodes or utilize LangChain’s tracing utilities (LangSmith) to record each step. We’ll discuss monitoring in detail later, but suffice to say that the graph-based design makes it easier to track how data flows through your agent, since you explicitly define the path and can observe state changes at each node.

## LangChainJS Integrations: LLMs, Tools, Memory, and Embeddings

Since LangGraphJS is built on LangChainJS, it can leverage all of LangChain’s powerful integrations ([LangGraph: Multi-Agent Workflows](https://blog.langchain.dev/langgraph-multi-agent-workflows/#:~:text=Another%20key%20difference%20between%20Autogen,LangChain%20integrations%20and%20LangSmith%20observability)). This means our graph-based agents can use language models, tool APIs, memory modules, and even embeddings seamlessly within nodes. Here are the key LangChainJS concepts we’ll use (and how they fit into LangGraph):

- **LLM Integration**: We can integrate large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI GPT-4 via LangChain’s wrappers. For example, LangChainJS provides a `ChatOpenAI` class that lets us call the OpenAI chat completions API easily ([Learn the basics](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/tutorials/quickstart/#:~:text=,langchain%2Flanggraph%2Fprebuilt)). In our graph, one or more nodes may invoke an LLM (e.g. to summarize news or reason about impacts). By including an LLM call inside a node’s function, we give our agent the ability to generate insights from text. LangGraphJS also supports a ReAct-style agent (Reason+Act loop) via tool nodes, but even without an automated loop, we can directly call LLMs in nodes to process information.  
- **Tools (Actions)**: Tools are external functions or APIs the agent can use, such as web search, calculators, or in our case, news and stock data APIs. LangChain provides a standard interface for tools, and LangGraphJS can incorporate them either by direct calls in nodes or by using **ToolNodes** that allow the LLM to decide when to use a tool. For simplicity, we’ll explicitly call APIs in our workflow (treating them as steps), but note that LangGraphJS also supports dynamic tool use in a ReAct pattern. Indeed, LangGraphJS comes with utility nodes like `ToolNode` to let an LLM agent invoke tools when it outputs a tool-use intent ([Learn the basics](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/tutorials/quickstart/#:~:text=A%20ToolNode%20%20enables%20the,or%20respond%20to%20the%20request)). In our implementation, we will create custom node functions to call NewsAPI and Finnhub (stock API) – effectively these are our “tools” for the agent. This demonstrates how to integrate any web service by writing a node or tool that wraps that API ([Learn the basics](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/tutorials/quickstart/#:~:text=,your%20application%20feel%20more%20responsive)).  
- **Memory**: By default, each run of a LangGraph agent is stateless (it doesn’t remember previous invocations). However, LangChainJS offers memory components to persist state across runs or maintain conversation context. For example, `MemorySaver` (a LangGraph utility) can checkpoint the state so that subsequent invocations of the agent continue where the last left off ([Learn the basics](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/tutorials/quickstart/#:~:text=%2F%2F%20Initialize%20memory%20to%20persist,tools%3A%20agentTools%2C%20checkpointSaver%3A%20agentCheckpointer%2C)). In our news analysis scenario, we might not need long conversation memory, but if the agent were interactive (say, a user asks follow-up questions about previous news), we could use memory to carry over the discussion. We’ll show how to configure memory (e.g., using a thread ID or a MemorySaver) so that our agent could handle continuous conversations or incremental analysis.  
- **Embeddings**: Embeddings allow the agent to represent text (like news articles) as vectors for semantic comparison. While not strictly needed for our basic pipeline, embeddings could enhance a news analysis system – for example, by finding related past news or clustering articles by topic/sentiment. LangChainJS integrates various embedding models (like OpenAI’s text embeddings) and vector stores. In LangGraphJS, you could incorporate an embedding step as a node (e.g., embed each news article and compare to a knowledge base of historical events). For this guide, we’ll mention how one *could* use embeddings, but our focus will remain on the core loop of fetching news, analyzing with an LLM, and fetching stock data. Keep in mind that any LangChainJS component (whether it’s an embedding model, a vector store lookup, etc.) can be used inside a LangGraph node due to LangGraph’s full integration with the ecosystem ([LangGraph: Multi-Agent Workflows](https://blog.langchain.dev/langgraph-multi-agent-workflows/#:~:text=Another%20key%20difference%20between%20Autogen,LangChain%20integrations%20and%20LangSmith%20observability)).

## Designing a Multi-Agent Workflow for Financial News Analysis

To tackle a complex task like analyzing financial news and its impact on stocks, a **multi-agent approach** can be very effective. Multi-agent systems break the problem into specialized sub-tasks, assigning each to a dedicated “agent” (or module) that is expert in that area ([Multi-agent network](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/multi_agent/multi-agent-collaboration/#:~:text=One%20way%20to%20approach%20complicated,agent%20network%20architecture)). Instead of one monolithic agent trying to do everything, we’ll have multiple cooperating agents – for example, one agent to retrieve news, another to interpret the news, and another to fetch relevant financial data. LangGraphJS is particularly well-suited to implementing this pattern, because it allows you to connect multiple agents in a graph structure (each agent can be a node or subgraph) with controlled transitions between them ([LangGraph: Multi-Agent Workflows](https://blog.langchain.dev/langgraph-multi-agent-workflows/#:~:text=This%20thinking%20lends%20itself%20incredibly,adding%20to%20the%20graph%27s%20state)).

**Why multi-agent?** Splitting responsibilities can make the system more robust and easier to develop. Each agent can use a custom prompt, tools, or even a different model best suited for its specific task ([LangGraph: Multi-Agent Workflows](https://blog.langchain.dev/langgraph-multi-agent-workflows/#:~:text=,without%20breaking%20the%20larger%20application)). For instance, a “NewsFetcher” agent might use a search API and need no LLM at all, while a “Analyst” agent might use a powerful LLM with a prompt tailored for financial reasoning. By focusing each agent, you reduce the cognitive load on any single LLM (an agent with just a few relevant tools is more likely to perform well than one with dozens of unrelated tools) ([LangGraph: Multi-Agent Workflows](https://blog.langchain.dev/langgraph-multi-agent-workflows/#:~:text=,without%20breaking%20the%20larger%20application)). You can also independently test and improve each part (e.g., refine the news parsing without affecting the stock lookup logic) ([LangGraph: Multi-Agent Workflows](https://blog.langchain.dev/langgraph-multi-agent-workflows/#:~:text=,without%20breaking%20the%20larger%20application)). In LangGraphJS, we implement this as a network of nodes: each agent-node handles its piece of work and then passes control (via edges) along to the next stage in the workflow.

 ([LangGraph: Multi-Agent Workflows](https://blog.langchain.dev/langgraph-multi-agent-workflows/)) *Example of a multi-agent workflow (from the “GPT-Newspaper” project) where different agents handle search, curation, writing, critique, etc., passing the task along in a pipeline ([LangGraph: Multi-Agent Workflows](https://blog.langchain.dev/langgraph-multi-agent-workflows/#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20new%20project,adds%20in%20a%20helpful%20cycle)). We will design a simpler graph with specialized agents for news retrieval, news analysis, and stock data lookup working together.* 

**Our Plan:** We will construct a graph with three main components (agents):

- **News Retrieval Agent:** Queries a news API to fetch the latest relevant articles for a given topic or company. This agent is essentially a tool-using step – it will likely call NewsAPI and return a set of news articles. 
- **News Analysis Agent:** Takes the news content and analyzes it using an LLM. This could involve summarizing the news, extracting key events or sentiments, and determining which stocks or companies are mentioned and how they might be impacted (positively or negatively). 
- **Stock Data Agent:** Given the insights (e.g. a particular company or ticker of interest), this agent calls a financial API (Finnhub) to retrieve current stock information (such as price, recent change, or other metrics). This provides real-time data to correlate with the news context.

These agents will interact in a **structured workflow**. The News Retrieval runs first, then feeds into the Analysis, which then triggers the Stock Data lookup. In LangGraph terms, each of these will be one or more nodes, connected sequentially (with possible conditional branches if needed). We could also allow iteration (for example, analyze multiple news articles one by one) or parallelism, but to keep it simple we’ll do a straightforward pipeline initially. By explicitly structuring it this way, we maintain control over the process – ensuring, for example, that we don’t call the stock API until we have something to look up, and that we always fetch news before analysis. 

Now that the plan is laid out, let’s dive into the **implementation step-by-step**. We’ll set up our project, create the LangGraph nodes for each agent’s function, and then tie them together into a single multi-agent graph.

## Integrating Real-Time News Data with NewsAPI

Our first agent will connect to a news source. We’ll use **NewsAPI**, a popular REST API for live news articles ([Documentation - News API](https://newsapi.org/docs#:~:text=News%20API%20is%20a%20simple,What%20top%20stories%20is)). To use NewsAPI, you need to sign up for an API key (it offers a free tier for development). Once you have a key, you can request news articles by various criteria (e.g., by keyword, date, sources, etc.). 

**Setup NewsAPI:** Suppose we want to retrieve news about a particular company or topic given by the user. We can use the NewsAPI `/v2/everything` endpoint with a query parameter. For example, to search for articles about “Tesla”, we’d call: 

```
GET https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q=Tesla&apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY
``` 

In Node.js (TypeScript), we can do this via `fetch` (Node 18+ has global fetch enabled) or any HTTP library like Axios. We will implement a LangGraph node function `fetchNewsNode` that takes our state (which will include a query or topic) and calls NewsAPI to get articles. The node will then update the state with the fetched news results.

**Code – News fetch node (simplified):**

```typescript
async function fetchNewsNode(state: { query: string, articles?: any[] }) {
  const apiKey = process.env.NEWSAPI_KEY;
  const query = state.query;
  const url = `https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q=${encodeURIComponent(query)}&apiKey=${apiKey}`;
  const res = await fetch(url);
  const data = await res.json();
  // For simplicity, take the first few articles
  state.articles = data.articles?.slice(0, 3) || [];
  return state;  // returning the updated state object
}
```

In a real implementation, you’d include error handling (and possibly more complex logic like filtering by date or source). But this function captures the essence: it uses the `query` from state, calls the API, and adds a list of `articles` to the state. Each article might be an object with properties like title, description, content, source, etc., as returned by NewsAPI.

*Integration into LangGraph:* We will add this function as a node in our StateGraph (e.g., name it `"news_fetch"`). Then we’ll connect an edge from the start to this node, so it’s the first step when our agent runs. By doing so, whenever the agent is invoked, it will automatically perform a live news query. This achieves real-time integration of news.

## Using an LLM to Analyze News Impact

With news articles in hand (stored in our state), the next agent will analyze them to extract insights. We’ll use an **LLM via LangChainJS** for this part. The idea is to prompt the LLM with the content or summary of those news articles and ask it: *“What is happening and how might it impact relevant stocks or companies?”* The LLM can then produce a summary of key points, possibly identifying companies mentioned and whether the news is good or bad for them.

**Choosing an LLM:** For this example, we can use OpenAI’s GPT-4 or GPT-3.5 (depending on API access), via the `ChatOpenAI` class in LangChainJS. Ensure you have your OpenAI API key ready (and set as `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY`). We’ll keep the model deterministic (temperature 0) for consistent outputs.

**Prompt Strategy:** We might give the LLM a prompt constructed from the news data. For instance, we could feed in the title and description of each article and ask the model to identify any companies or stock tickers and describe the likely impact. A simple prompt could be:

“Here are some news articles:\n[Article 1 title and summary]\n[Article 2 title and summary]...\n\n**Task**: For each company mentioned, explain if the news is positive, negative, or neutral for its stock and why.”

We might need to be mindful of token limits if articles are long – one approach is to summarize each article first (NewsAPI often provides a short description we can use). For now, assume we use the provided `description` or a truncated content.

**Code – Analysis node:**

```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { AIMessage, HumanMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";

const llm = new ChatOpenAI({ modelName: "gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature: 0 });  // LLM instance, adjust modelName if needed

async function analyzeNewsNode(state: { articles: any[], analysis?: string }) {
  if (!state.articles || state.articles.length === 0) {
    state.analysis = "No news articles found for analysis.";
    return state;
  }
  // Construct a prompt from the articles
  let intro = "Analyze the following news and their impact on stocks:\n";
  let newsContent = "";
  for (const art of state.articles) {
    newsContent += `- ${art.title}: ${art.description}\n`;
  }
  const userPrompt = intro + newsContent + "\nResponse:";
  // Call the LLM with the assembled prompt
  const response = await llm.invoke([ new HumanMessage(userPrompt) ]);
  // The LLM returns an AIMessage; extract text
  const analysisText = (response as AIMessage).content;
  state.analysis = analysisText;
  return state;
}
```

In this node, we use `llm.invoke()` with a list of messages (LangChain uses a chat message interface; here we send one HumanMessage containing our prompt). The result is an AIMessage from the model, which we take as `analysis`. We update `state.analysis` with the model’s output.

This analysis might say something like: *“Company X is mentioned regarding a product launch which is likely positive for its stock. Company Y is facing a lawsuit, a negative development for its stock.”* — whatever the model concludes from the news input.

A few things to note:

- We ensured to handle the case of no articles (so the agent doesn’t ask the LLM with an empty prompt).
- We kept the prompt concise by using titles and descriptions. If needed, one could enhance this by fetching full article text or adding more context, but be cautious of token limits.
- We could also ask the LLM to output a structured format (e.g., a JSON with company and sentiment), but for simplicity, we’ll take freeform text and possibly parse it minimally (e.g., to find a company name for the next step).

**Embeddings Note:** If we wanted, we could replace or supplement this LLM analysis with an embeddings approach – for example, embedding each article and comparing to known impactful events. However, implementing that fully is beyond our current scope. Our use of the LLM here is effectively doing a comprehension and reasoning task that could also be achieved by an embeddings + classifier pipeline. 

After this node runs, the state now contains an `analysis` string. The next agent can use this to figure out which stock data to fetch.

## Fetching Stock Data with Finnhub API

The final piece is to retrieve **stock information** for companies of interest. Suppose our LLM analysis identified “Company X” as being impacted. We’d want to fetch Company X’s latest stock price or other financial data to include in our final answer. **Finnhub** is a great API for real-time market data (with a free tier for limited usage). Given a stock ticker symbol, Finnhub can return the current price, percent change, etc. It can also fetch company news or fundamental data, but in our case NewsAPI covered news content, so we’ll use Finnhub for numbers.

**Setup Finnhub:** Like NewsAPI, you need an API key for Finnhub. Once you have it, you can call endpoints such as `https://finnhub.io/api/v1/quote?symbol=AAPL&token=YOUR_TOKEN` to get quote data for Apple, for example. The response is a JSON with fields like `c` (current price), `d` (change), `dp` (percent change), etc.

We need to decide **what symbol to query**. This could be determined in various ways:
- We might hardcode a symbol for demonstration.
- Or parse the LLM’s analysis text to find a company name or ticker. (For a robust solution, we could maintain a mapping of company names to ticker symbols and check if any known company names appear in the analysis.)
- For simplicity, let’s assume we know the relevant ticker from context (or we search for one in the analysis string). For example, if the query was “Tesla”, likely Tesla (TSLA) is the stock to check. Alternatively, we could include the company/ticker in the initial user input.

To keep the scope manageable, we’ll assume the topic is centered on one primary company or ticker (which could be part of the initial query). We’ll include that in our state as `ticker` (maybe set by the user or by parsing the query), so the stock agent knows what to look up.

**Code – Stock fetch node:**

```typescript
async function fetchStockNode(state: { ticker?: string, stockInfo?: any, analysis?: string }) {
  const token = process.env.FINNHUB_TOKEN;
  let targetTicker = state.ticker;
  // If ticker not provided, try to extract from analysis text (naive approach)
  if (!targetTicker && state.analysis) {
    const match = state.analysis.match(/[A-Z]{1,5}/);  // find all-caps word (simple ticker guess)
    if (match) targetTicker = match[0];
  }
  if (!targetTicker) {
    state.stockInfo = { error: "No ticker to lookup" };
    return state;
  }
  const url = `https://finnhub.io/api/v1/quote?symbol=${targetTicker}&token=${token}`;
  const res = await fetch(url);
  const data = await res.json();
  state.stockInfo = data;
  return state;
}
```

This node looks for a `ticker` in state (which we could set initially if the user explicitly provided a company/ticker). If not found, it tries a very basic regex on the analysis text to pick up a sequence of capital letters as a potential ticker (this is a heuristic – in practice, you’d want a more reliable method!). Then it calls Finnhub’s quote API for that ticker and attaches the result to `state.stockInfo`. If no ticker is found at all, it sets an error message.

The output `stockInfo` might look like: `{ c: 150.30, d: -2.5, dp: -1.64, h: 155, l: 149, o: 153, pc: 152 }` (for example), meaning current price $150.30, down $2.5 today, -1.64% change, etc.

After this node, our state contains all the key pieces: the original query, the list of news articles, the analysis text, and the stock data.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

Now that we have our plan and each component described, let's walk through building this system in TypeScript. We’ll create a project, add LangGraphJS and necessary packages, define our state and nodes, compile the graph, and then run some tests. Follow these steps:

1. **Project Setup**: Make sure you have **Node.js 18+** installed (for native fetch and ESM support). Create a new project directory and initialize it (e.g., `npm init -y`). Then install LangChainJS and LangGraphJS packages, along with any specific integrations we need (OpenAI and community tools). For example, run:  
   ```bash
   npm install @langchain/core @langchain/langgraph @langchain/openai @langchain/community
   ```  
   This will install the core LangChain classes, LangGraph, OpenAI LLM support, and community tools (the community package isn’t strictly needed for our example, but includes useful tools like web search) ([Learn the basics](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/tutorials/quickstart/#:~:text=You%20can%20install%20these%20dependencies,npm%20command%20in%20your%20terminal)). Also install any other dependencies you plan to use (if using `node-fetch` in older Node versions, install it; with Node 18+, you can skip that). Make sure to set up environment variables for API keys: e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `NEWSAPI_KEY`, and `FINNHUB_TOKEN` in a `.env` file or via your shell, so that our code can access `process.env[...]` for those.

2. **Define the State and Initialize LangGraph**: Decide what your state will contain. For our system, we can define a TypeScript interface for clarity:  
   ```typescript
   interface NewsAnalysisState {
     query: string;
     ticker?: string;
     articles?: any[];
     analysis?: string;
     stockInfo?: any;
   }
   ```  
   This state will hold the user’s query (which might include a company name or topic), an optional ticker symbol (if provided or derived), the fetched articles, the LLM analysis, and the fetched stock info. Now, import LangGraph’s `StateGraph` and special markers:  
   ```typescript
   import { StateGraph, START, END } from "@langchain/langgraph";
   const graph = new StateGraph<NewsAnalysisState>();
   ```  
   `START` and `END` are constants indicating the start and end of the graph. We’ll use them when connecting edges. 

3. **Implement Nodes (Agents) Functions**: As sketched above, implement the three main node functions: `fetchNewsNode`, `analyzeNewsNode`, and `fetchStockNode`. You can place these in your code (ensure to import any needed classes like `ChatOpenAI` and message classes for the LLM node). Each function should follow the signature `(state) => state` (or return a partial state or a `Command` object). In our simple case, returning the modified state object is fine – LangGraph will merge it into the overall state. Make sure to handle async calls (mark functions `async` and use `await` for fetch and LLM calls). If using the code from earlier sections, double-check that your API keys are being read from environment and that error cases are handled (e.g., if APIs fail or return nothing, you still return the state).

4. **Add Nodes to the Graph**: With the functions ready, we register them as nodes in the `StateGraph`. For example:  
   ```typescript
   graph.addNode("news_fetch", fetchNewsNode)
        .addNode("analyze_news", analyzeNewsNode)
        .addNode("stock_fetch", fetchStockNode);
   ```  
   We’ve given each node a name (strings like `"news_fetch"`) for reference. Next, add edges to define the execution order:  
   ```typescript
   graph.addEdge(START, "news_fetch")            // start -> news_fetch
        .addEdge("news_fetch", "analyze_news")   // then -> analyze_news
        .addEdge("analyze_news", "stock_fetch")  // then -> stock_fetch
        .addEdge("stock_fetch", END);            // end after stock_fetch
   ```  
   This sequence ensures the workflow: News fetch runs first, then analysis, then stock fetch, and then the agent ends. If you wanted a conditional branch (say, only fetch stock if analysis found a ticker), you could use `addConditionalEdges` with a function to decide the next node ([Learn the basics](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/tutorials/quickstart/#:~:text=A%20ToolNode%20%20enables%20the,or%20respond%20to%20the%20request)). For example, `graph.addConditionalEdges("analyze_news", (state) => state.ticker ? "stock_fetch" : END)`. But for simplicity, we fetch the stock anyway (our stock node itself will handle if ticker is missing). 

   At this point, our LangGraph is defined. We now compile it into a runnable function.

5. **Compile and Invoke the Agent**: LangGraphJS allows you to compile the StateGraph into a LangChain **Runnable** object (which has an `invoke` method to execute it). Do:  
   ```typescript
   const agentApp = graph.compile();
   ```  
   This `agentApp` is now our multi-step agent. We can call `agentApp.invoke(inputState)` to run it. Typically, the input state will contain at least the `query` (and maybe `ticker` if known). For example:  
   ```typescript
   const initialState: NewsAnalysisState = { query: "Tesla new model launch", ticker: "TSLA" };
   const finalState = await agentApp.invoke(initialState);
   console.log("Analysis result:\n", finalState.analysis);
   console.log("Stock info:\n", finalState.stockInfo);
   ```  
   When you run this (e.g. with `tsx index.ts` if using tsx to run TypeScript directly), the agent will go through each step. You should see network calls happen for NewsAPI and Finnhub, and an LLM response in between. The final output printed might look like: 
   - Analysis result: *"Tesla’s new model launch is a positive development expected to boost market sentiment for TSLA. The stock could see an uptick as investors react to the news..."*  
   - Stock info: *{ c: 250.10, d: 5.5, dp: 2.25, ... }* 

   Feel free to try different queries. For instance, ask about a sector or another company: update the `query` and `ticker` accordingly. The agent will fetch news on that topic and analyze. You can also omit the ticker and rely on the analysis node to detect it (with our simple regex or by improving that logic).

6. **Incorporate Memory (Optional)**: If you plan to invoke the agent multiple times in a conversational manner, you might want it to remember previous interactions. LangGraphJS supports memory via checkpointing. You can integrate LangChain’s `MemorySaver` as a **checkpointSaver** when compiling the graph, which allows the agent to persist state between runs ([Learn the basics](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/tutorials/quickstart/#:~:text=%2F%2F%20Initialize%20memory%20to%20persist,tools%3A%20agentTools%2C%20checkpointSaver%3A%20agentCheckpointer%2C)). For example:  
   ```typescript
   import { MemorySaver } from "@langchain/langgraph";
   const agentApp = graph.compile({ checkpointManager: new MemorySaver() });
   ```  
   Then when invoking, pass a `config` with a `thread_id`:  
   ```typescript
   await agentApp.invoke({ query: "Apple earnings report" }, { configurable: { thread_id: "session1" } });
   ```  
   Using the same `thread_id` on subsequent calls will ensure the state (e.g., conversation history or any stored data) carries over. In our simple pipeline, memory is less critical, but this is how you’d add long-term conversation memory if extending the agent into a chat that can discuss multiple news over time.

7. **Test and Refine**: Run your program and observe the outputs. You might print intermediate state after each node for debugging (e.g., add `console.log` inside `fetchNewsNode` to print the titles of fetched articles, and inside `analyzeNewsNode` to show the prompt or the raw LLM reply). This can help verify each part works. If the LLM output is too verbose or not focused, refine the prompt. If the news fetch returns irrelevant articles, consider tweaking the query (perhaps adding filters like `language=en` or specifying sources in NewsAPI). If the ticker extraction fails, you could improve it by maintaining a list of known tickers or using a simple mapping (for instance, if query contains "Tesla", set ticker TSLA directly).

Each step of building this system reinforces a core LangGraphJS concept: adding **nodes** (we added three function nodes), connecting **edges** to shape execution, invoking an **LLM** tool, and calling external APIs as **tools**. We also saw how to use the **shared state** to pass information between agents (news agent put articles in state, analysis agent read those and put analysis, etc.). This structured approach is very transparent – at any point, you can inspect the state or adjust the flow without dealing with a black-box chain.

## Monitoring and Debugging the Workflow

As you experiment with the agent, it’s important to have good observability. LangChain offers **LangSmith** for tracing and debugging LLM applications, and LangGraphJS is compatible with it ([LangGraph: Multi-Agent Workflows](https://blog.langchain.dev/langgraph-multi-agent-workflows/#:~:text=Another%20key%20difference%20between%20Autogen,LangChain%20integrations%20and%20LangSmith%20observability)). By enabling tracing, you can get a detailed log of each step in the graph, timings, and inputs/outputs, which is immensely helpful for diagnosing issues or evaluating performance.

**Enable LangSmith Tracing:** Set the environment variables as suggested in LangChain’s docs ([Learn the basics](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/tutorials/quickstart/#:~:text=LangSmith%C2%B6)), for example: 
```bash
export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=<your LangSmith API key>
export LANGCHAIN_PROJECT="LangGraphJS NewsAgent"
``` 
When these are active, each run of your agent will be recorded to your LangSmith account. You can then inspect the trace: you’d see nodes “news_fetch”, “analyze_news”, “stock_fetch” with their inputs and outputs, any errors, and latency. This pinpoint view helps ensure each part is functioning and lets you spot if, say, the LLM took an unexpected turn or an API returned an error. LangSmith basically gives you “best-in-class observability” for LangGraph – allowing you to debug, test, and monitor your agent workflows ([Multi-agent network](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/multi_agent/multi-agent-collaboration/#:~:text=Set%20up%20LangSmith%20for%20LangGraph,development)).

**Logging and Visualizing:** In addition to LangSmith, you can always add logging in your code for quick debugging. For example, log the state right before ending: `console.log("Final state:", JSON.stringify(finalState, null, 2))` to see all data collected. If you want to visualize the graph structure itself, LangGraphJS can output a diagram. In a Jupyter notebook environment, you could do `graph.drawMermaidPng()` to get a Mermaid diagram of the nodes and edges ([Learn the basics](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/tutorials/quickstart/#:~:text=The%20createReactAgent%20constructor%20lets%20you,visual%20representation%20of%20the%20graph)). In a local setup, you might instead output the Mermaid markdown or use the CLI from `langgraphjs-api` to visualize the state machine. This diagram helps verify the structure (especially for more complex graphs with branches or loops). 

During development, test each node individually if possible. For instance, you can call `await fetchNewsNode({ query: "XYZ" })` outside the graph to see if it returns what you expect. Because our design is modular, you could even run the LLM analysis node on some sample text manually. This modularity is a strength of the multi-agent approach – each piece can often be validated on its own.

Finally, consider edge cases: What if NewsAPI returns no articles? (Our code handles that by a check in the analysis node.) What if the LLM doesn’t mention any company? (Our stock node will then have no ticker and report an error.) You can add more graceful handling as needed, such as defaulting the ticker to the query company or skipping the stock lookup if none is found. These conditions can be implemented either in-code or by using conditional edges as noted.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

By following this guide, you’ve practically explored LangGraphJS: you created nodes and edges to form a custom agent, integrated an LLM and external APIs, and orchestrated a multi-agent workflow. Along the way, we touched on LangChainJS fundamentals like tools and memory, and demonstrated real-time data integration and debugging techniques. The end result is a simplified but functional **financial news analysis agent** that can fetch news and reason about stock impacts.

As next steps, you can extend this project in many ways. For example, try adding another agent/node that provides context (e.g., a **Knowledge Base Agent** that retrieves past stock performance or relevant financial metrics from a database to help the analysis). You could also make the interaction conversational – allow the user to ask follow-up questions about the news, using memory to carry the conversation. Another idea is to incorporate an **embeddings-based retrieval**: maintain a vector store of past major news events, embed the current news and find similar cases to inform the analysis (this would use LangChain’s embedding and vector store classes, enriching the agent’s insight).

Keep experimenting with LangGraphJS – it’s a flexible framework, and building by doing is the best way to master it. With nodes and edges, you have Lego-like building blocks for AI workflows, so you can gradually construct very sophisticated multi-agent systems. Happy coding, and may your AI agents deliver sharp insights on all the latest financial news!
