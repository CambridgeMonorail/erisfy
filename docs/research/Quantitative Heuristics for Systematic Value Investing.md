# Quantitative Heuristics for Systematic Value Investing

Value investing can be implemented with strict, data-driven rules. Below we outline **fundamental factor thresholds**, **market condition signals**, **momentum/technical overlays**, and **backtested evidence** for systematic value strategies. Each heuristic is quantifiable and objective, providing clear rules that investors can implement without subjective judgment.

## Fundamental Factors: Key Metrics & Thresholds

Value investors often screen for stocks that are statistically cheap based on fundamental ratios. Here are common metrics and specific numeric thresholds used in quantitative value strategies:

- **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:** A classic rule is to buy stocks with P/E below a certain cutoff (indicating low price relative to earnings). Benjamin Graham’s criterion was not to pay more than 15 times earnings ([Graham Number: Definition, Formula, Example, and Limitations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/graham-number.asp#:~:text=a%20per,5x)) ([Graham Number: Definition, Formula, Example, and Limitations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/graham-number.asp#:~:text=The%20Graham%20number%20is%20named,5)). Stocks with P/E well below the market average (often < 15, or < 10 for “deep value”) are favored. Empirical research has long confirmed the efficacy: Basu (1977) found that low P/E stocks delivered significantly higher returns than high P/E stocks, demonstrating the “value effect” ([Value Investing with Rule-Based Stock Selection and Data Mining](https://epub.lib.aalto.fi/fi/ethesis/pdf/13592/hse_ethesis_13592.pdf#:~:text=and%201980s,confirmed%20by%20dozens%20of%20other)).

- **Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio:** Value screens frequently require a low P/B, since paying below a company’s book value is a hallmark of classic value investing. Graham’s rules included a P/B not above 1.5 ([Graham Number: Definition, Formula, Example, and Limitations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/graham-number.asp#:~:text=a%20per,5x)). Many quantitative investors look for **P/B < 1.0** (buying at or below book value) or at least below ~1.5. In academic terms, high book-to-market (the inverse of P/B) defines value stocks. Fama–French studies show companies with high book-to-market (low P/B) consistently outperform growth stocks with low book-to-market ([High Minus Low (HML): Definition and Uses in Finance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/high_minus_low.asp#:~:text=factors%20used%20in%20the%20Fama,values%2C%20known%20as%20growth%20stocks)). For example, over the long run, value stocks (low P/B) have beaten growth stocks by roughly 4–5% per year on average ([When It’s Value vs. Growth, History Is on Value’s Side | Dimensional](https://www.dimensional.com/ca-en/insights/when-its-value-versus-growth-history-is-on-values-side#:~:text=While%20disappointing%20periods%20emerge%20from,1927%2C%20as%20Exhibit%201%20shows)) ([When It’s Value vs. Growth, History Is on Value’s Side | Dimensional](https://www.dimensional.com/ca-en/insights/when-its-value-versus-growth-history-is-on-values-side#:~:text=have%20often%20shown%20up%20quickly,1927%2C%20as%20Exhibit%201%20shows)).

- **Enterprise Value to EBIT (EV/EBIT) – Earnings Yield:** EV/EBIT is a comprehensive valuation metric (enterprise value accounts for debt and equity). A low EV/EBIT (high earnings yield) indicates a bargain. Many quant strategies seek EV/EBIT below **10** (or even single-digits) as a rule of thumb for attractive value. In fact, studies find EV/EBIT to be one of the most effective value factors: it “nearly always” delivers the best returns compared to other single ratios ([How and why to implement an EBIT to enterprise value investment strategy | Quant Investing](https://www.quant-investing.com/blog/how-and-why-to-implement-an-ebit-to-enterprise-value-investment-strategy#:~:text=Earnings%20before%20Interest%20and%20Taxes,give%20you%20the%20best%20returns)). Practically, a screen might filter the top 20% of stocks with the highest earnings yield (EBIT/EV). Joel Greenblatt’s *Magic Formula* popularized a combined rule: select stocks with **high earnings yield (EBIT/EV)** and **high Return on Capital** – effectively picking companies that are both cheap and high-quality ([Magic formula investing - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_formula_investing#:~:text=4,losers%20one%20week%20before%20the)) ([Magic formula investing - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_formula_investing#:~:text=5,week%20after%20the%20year%20mark)). This formula doesn’t use fixed cutoffs but ranks all stocks on these metrics and buys the top-ranked (typically corresponding to very low EV/EBIT values, often < 8–10).

- **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) or Return on Equity (ROE):** While value investing emphasizes low prices, adding a profitability threshold can avoid “cheap but bad” companies. Some systematic value approaches require **ROE** or **ROIC above 10–15%** to ensure the business generates strong returns. For example, Greenblatt’s Magic Formula explicitly looks for high ROC (ROIC) alongside low valuation ([Magic formula investing - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_formula_investing#:~:text=4,losers%20one%20week%20before%20the)). In practice, this means focusing on firms whose ROIC ranks in the top tier (often > 15–20%). By demanding solid ROIC or ROE, investors tilt toward companies that use capital efficiently, preventing the inclusion of troubled firms even if their ratios are low. This rule is quantifiable (e.g. “ROIC > 15%” as a screen criterion) and helps merge value with quality.

- **Composite Value Scores (Multiple Criteria):** Rather than any single ratio, quantitative “value scores” combine several metrics. For instance, James O’Shaughnessy’s research uses a *Value Composite* (blending P/E, P/B, P/Sales, EBITDA/EV, etc.) to rank stocks – only those in the top decile by the composite are selected. Another example is **Graham’s combined criterion**: he suggested that **P/E × P/B should not exceed 22.5** (since 15 × 1.5 = 22.5) ([Graham Number: Definition, Formula, Example, and Limitations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/graham-number.asp#:~:text=a%20per,5x)) ([Graham Number: Definition, Formula, Example, and Limitations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/graham-number.asp#:~:text=The%20Graham%20number%20is%20named,5)). This rule ensures a stock is reasonably valued on both earnings and assets. In practice, an investor might screen for *either* P/E < 15 and P/B < 1.5, *or* the combined product < 22.5. These dual-threshold rules add robustness – a stock must be cheap on multiple measures.

- **Financial Strength (Piotroski F-Score):** Professor Joseph Piotroski developed a 9-point F-Score to identify healthy companies among low P/B stocks. Each criterion is binary (e.g. positive net income = 1 point, increasing gross margin = 1 point, etc.). A **high F-Score (7–9 out of 9)** indicates the firm’s fundamentals are improving. A rule-based value strategy can require a minimum F-Score (for example, “invest in stocks with P/B in the lowest quartile and F-Score ≥ 7”). This systematically weeds out “value traps.” Piotroski’s study showed that value stocks with high F-Scores significantly outperform those with low F-Scores – in his backtest, a portfolio of high book-to-market stocks with F-Score 8–9 beat the market by about **7.5% per year** on average ([Joseph Piotroski: Separating Winners from Losers in Value Investing – Validea's Guru Investor Blog](https://blog.validea.com/joseph-piotroski-separating-winners-from-losers-in-value-investing/#:~:text=were%20remarkable,per%20year%20on%20average)). Thus, using F-Score ≥ 8 as a rule can boost returns by focusing on fundamentally sound value stocks.

In summary, fundamental heuristics for value investing often boil down to *“buy cheap, but make sure it’s solid.”* Concrete rules include buying below certain P/E or P/B thresholds, focusing on top percentile earnings yields, and insisting on indicators of quality (high ROIC or strong F-Score). These rules are straightforward to implement with financial data – for example, an investor could screen a database for **P/E < 15, P/B < 1.5, ROE > 12%, and F-Score ≥ 7** as a strict value stock selection filter.

## Market Signals: Quantitative Rules from Market Conditions & Macro Indicators

Beyond company-specific fundamentals, systematic value investors can incorporate broader market and economic signals. These rules help indicate when value opportunities are most attractive based on volatility, sentiment, or macro valuation measures:

- **CAPE Ratio (Shiller P/E) as a Valuation Gauge:** The cyclically-adjusted P/E for the overall market (10-year inflation-adjusted earnings) is a well-known barometer. A **high CAPE** suggests the market is expensive, whereas a low CAPE signals undervaluation. While not for precise market timing, CAPE is *“a powerful predictor of long-term returns”* ([CAPE Fear: Why CAPE Naysayers Are Wrong | Research Affiliates](https://www.researchaffiliates.com/publications/articles/645-cape-fear-why-cape-naysayers-are-wrong#:~:text=,term%20market%20returns)). A rule-based investor might choose to **overweight stocks when CAPE is in its lowest historical quartile** (indicating pessimism and good future returns) and be cautious or underweight when CAPE is extremely high. For instance, the U.S. CAPE long-term average is ~16; at peaks (e.g. ~30+), forward 10-year returns have historically been much lower ([CAPE Fear: Why CAPE Naysayers Are Wrong | Research Affiliates](https://www.researchaffiliates.com/publications/articles/645-cape-fear-why-cape-naysayers-are-wrong#:~:text=,term%20market%20returns)). In late 2017, CAPE exceeded 32 (about double its norm), clearly flagging an overvalued market ([CAPE Fear: Why CAPE Naysayers Are Wrong | Research Affiliates](https://www.researchaffiliates.com/publications/articles/645-cape-fear-why-cape-naysayers-are-wrong#:~:text=,the%20US%20market%20is%20expensive)). A systematic heuristic could be: *“If CAPE > 25 (very high), concentrate on only the most compelling value stocks or hold extra cash; if CAPE < 15 (low), it’s a broad value buying opportunity.”* This uses a quantifiable threshold to adjust one’s aggressiveness based on macro valuation.

- **Market Volatility Index (VIX) as a Contrarian Signal:** The VIX “fear index” measures expected volatility. Historically, **very high VIX levels (e.g. > 30)** coincide with market distress and panic. A value investor can use this as a mechanical buy signal – *“be greedy when others are fearful.”* For example, a rule might be to deploy capital into value stocks when the VIX spikes above a certain level (say 30), which often occurs during market sell-offs. Such conditions have marked excellent entry points; a high VIX reflects extreme investor fear ([Understanding VIX or Volatility Index - TD Bank](https://www.td.com/ca/en/investing/direct-investing/articles/understanding-vix#:~:text=Understanding%20VIX%20or%20Volatility%20Index,investor%20fear%20and%20increased)) and frequently precedes a market rebound. Conversely, an extremely low VIX (< 12) indicates complacency; a rule-based investor might refrain from new purchases during such frothy periods. This approach is quantifiable: one could track the VIX and only execute a value stock screen if VIX is, for instance, in the top 20% of its historical range (signaling fear). By doing so, the investor systematically buys when market sentiment is weakest, aligning with the value philosophy of bargain-hunting during volatility.

- **“Fed Model” – Earnings Yield vs. Bond Yield Gap:** This heuristic compares the stock market’s earnings yield (E/P) to the 10-year Treasury yield. It’s based on the idea that, in equilibrium, earnings yield should be similar to bond yields. If the **earnings yield is much higher** than the bond yield (stocks “yield” more than bonds), stocks are considered undervalued; if it’s lower, stocks may be overvalued. A rule could be: *“Only invest in value stocks when the earnings yield of the market exceeds the 10-year bond yield by at least X%.”* For example, suppose the S&P 500’s earnings yield is 6% and the 10-year yield is 3%; the spread is +3%, indicating a favorable environment for equities (and value stocks within equities). On the other hand, if bond yields rise above the earnings yield, one might hold off on equity purchases. This rule ties macro conditions (interest rates) to value opportunities. It can be quantified by monitoring the yield spread – many practitioners historically viewed a positive spread as bullish for stocks. (Notably, variations of this “Fed model” exist, and it’s a heuristic rather than ironclad law, but it provides a data-driven market context for value investing.)

- **Market Cap to GDP (Buffett Indicator):** This indicator measures the total stock market value relative to the economy. It has clear numeric interpretation: *“>100% indicates overvaluation, ~50-75% indicates undervaluation”* by historical standards ([Stock Market Capitalization-to-GDP Ratio: Definition and Formula](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapgdp.asp#:~:text=Typically%2C%20a%20result%20that%20is,said%20to%20be%20modestly%20undervalued)). An investor can set rules based on this ratio – for instance, **only commit new funds to stocks when Market Cap/GDP is below 100%** (i.e. the stock market is not grossly overpriced relative to GDP). Conversely, if this ratio is extremely high (say > 150%), a rule-based value investor might become very selective or even wait for a correction. For example, in the early 2000s the U.S. Market Cap/GDP approached ~140%, signaling expensive conditions; by 2008–09 it fell below 70%, flashing a deep value opportunity. Using this measure, one might quantify thresholds: *“Buy aggressively if Market Cap/GDP < 80%. Be cautious or sell if > 120%.”* Warren Buffett himself noted this ratio as “the best single measure” of market valuation – it gives a numeric grounding for when the entire market climate is favorable for value picks.

- **Economic Cycle Indicators:** Certain macroeconomic metrics can serve as triggers in a systematic value approach. For instance, one could use the **unemployment rate or PMI (Purchasing Managers’ Index)** in rules. A contrarian value rule might be: *“Increase equity exposure when unemployment is above Y% (say, >8%) and just starting to decline.”* A high unemployment rate often coincides with market bottoms (recessions), which historically deliver strong subsequent stock returns as the economy recovers. Similarly, an investor could require that a recession indicator (like two consecutive quarters of GDP decline) has occurred before deploying a large “value portfolio” – essentially buying when macro news is bad and valuations depressed. Another example: **credit spreads** (the gap between corporate bond yields and Treasuries) quantify financial stress; a rule might allocate more to value stocks when spreads are unusually wide (e.g., high-yield spreads > 6%), under the premise that risk aversion is high and stocks are likely cheap. These rules ensure a systematic “buy low” approach on a market-wide scale, using numeric macro thresholds as the trigger.

In short, market-level heuristics add a timing or context element to value investing. They are entirely data-driven – e.g., using a volatility index reading or a valuation ratio of the entire market – to decide *when* to emphasize value strategies. By incorporating them, investors can systematically tilt their value exposure in favorable environments (high fear, low valuations) and pull back when broad conditions look expensive or risky.

## Momentum & Technical Indicators within a Value Framework

Momentum and technical signals can complement value investing by helping avoid traps and identify better entry points. Though value investing is fundamentally about underpricing, adding **trend-following rules** provides an objective check on price behavior. Here are rule-based ways to blend momentum/technical factors into a value strategy:

- **Momentum Overlay – Positive Price Trend Requirement:** One simple heuristic: *only buy value stocks that have shown recent positive momentum.* In practice, this could mean requiring that a stock is above a certain moving average or has positive returns over the last 6–12 months. For example, an investor might screen for stocks with low P/B and P/E **and also require 6-month price return > 0%**. This rule ensures the stock’s price is not still in decline. Research supports this approach: combining value and momentum factors yields higher risk-adjusted returns than either alone, owing to their complementary effects ([Using Momentum to Find Value -](https://alphaarchitect.com/2022/05/using-momentum-to-find-value/#:~:text=,The)) ([Using Momentum to Find Value -](https://alphaarchitect.com/2022/05/using-momentum-to-find-value/#:~:text=correlation%20averaged%20,fraction%20of%20the%20value%20and)). In fact, value and momentum tend to be negatively correlated (around –0.5 to –0.6), so a stock that is both a value and displaying momentum is a particularly powerful combination ([Using Momentum to Find Value -](https://alphaarchitect.com/2022/05/using-momentum-to-find-value/#:~:text=,The)) ([Using Momentum to Find Value -](https://alphaarchitect.com/2022/05/using-momentum-to-find-value/#:~:text=correlation%20averaged%20,fraction%20of%20the%20value%20and)). A concrete implementation is described by quantitative investors who **pick the top percentile of earnings yield stocks and then narrow that list to those with the strongest 6- or 12-month price appreciation** ([How and why to implement an EBIT to enterprise value investment strategy | Quant Investing](https://www.quant-investing.com/blog/how-and-why-to-implement-an-ebit-to-enterprise-value-investment-strategy#:~:text=To%20implement%20this%20strategy%2C%20you,should)) ([How and why to implement an EBIT to enterprise value investment strategy | Quant Investing](https://www.quant-investing.com/blog/how-and-why-to-implement-an-ebit-to-enterprise-value-investment-strategy#:~:text=How%20can%20I%20further%20enhance,EV%20strategy%20to%20improve%20returns)). Such a strategy systematically buys *cheap stocks that the market sentiment has started to warm up to*. The rule can be: *“Of the stocks passing fundamental value screens, invest only in those with top-quartile 12-month total return.”* This avoids catching “falling knives” and has been shown to significantly boost returns compared to value alone ([How and why to implement an EBIT to enterprise value investment strategy | Quant Investing](https://www.quant-investing.com/blog/how-and-why-to-implement-an-ebit-to-enterprise-value-investment-strategy#:~:text=How%20can%20I%20further%20enhance,EV%20strategy%20to%20improve%20returns)).

- **Avoiding Lowest Momentum and High Volatility Stocks:** Another rule-based tactic is to explicitly *exclude* value stocks with the worst technical characteristics. For instance, one could **eliminate any candidate that is in the bottom 10% of the market by 12-month momentum**, even if it looks cheap. Similarly, extremely volatile stocks can be removed (for example, avoid stocks with **beta in the top 5%**). This approach was highlighted by Gray and Vogel (quantitative value researchers): they “systematically eliminate” the worst momentum decile and the highest beta few percent of stocks from their value portfolio ([The Quantitative Value Investing Philosophy -](https://alphaarchitect.com/2014/10/the-quantitative-value-investing-philosophy/#:~:text=We%20systematically%20eliminate%20firms%20that,the%20worst%20of%20the%20worst)). The rationale is that extremely poor price action or sky-high volatility may indicate fundamental problems or high risk that pure valuation metrics don’t capture. By embedding this as a rule – e.g. *“Exclude stocks with 12-month momentum < –30% or beta > 1.5× the market”* – a value investor reduces the likelihood of severe drawdowns. It’s a disciplined way to sidestep potential value traps (companies that are cheap for good reason). Empirical evidence backs this: price signal filters improved predictive power more than complex financial models in one study ([The Quantitative Value Investing Philosophy -](https://alphaarchitect.com/2014/10/the-quantitative-value-investing-philosophy/#:~:text=We%20systematically%20eliminate%20firms%20that,the%20worst%20of%20the%20worst)). In short, the rule is: **if a stock is among the worst performers or most volatile, don’t buy it even if it looks undervalued**.

- **Moving Average and Breakout Rules:** Technical rules like moving averages can be quantified and used to confirm trends. A popular systematic rule is the **200-day moving average**: for example, *“Buy only if the stock’s price is above its 200-day moving average.”* This ensures the long-term trend isn’t downward. Conversely, one could set a rule to sell (or not buy) any stock that breaches a long-term moving average from above, as that may indicate a trend reversal. Another technical heuristic is using **relative strength index (RSI)** or similar – e.g. *“Buy value stocks that have an RSI below 30 (oversold) and are starting to tick up.”* However, momentum investing typically favors strength, so requiring an *upward* crossover (price crossing above a moving average, RSI exiting oversold territory, etc.) can be more effective. These rules are easily coded and add an extra layer of confirmation: the idea is to only commit to a value stock once the market’s price action shows some stabilization. While pure value investors might ignore price, quantitative studies find that a trend-following rule can improve timing and avoid prolonged slumps.

- **Composite Quality/Momentum Scores:** Some advanced quant models incorporate technicals into a single score alongside fundamentals. For example, a **“Value-Trend” score** might rank stocks by how their valuation metrics have improved or deteriorated over time ([Using Momentum to Find Value -](https://alphaarchitect.com/2022/05/using-momentum-to-find-value/#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D)) ([Using Momentum to Find Value -](https://alphaarchitect.com/2022/05/using-momentum-to-find-value/#:~:text=relative%20value%20in%20a%20stock,%E2%80%9D)). Another approach is the **Piotroski F-Score plus momentum** – after computing F-Score for fundamental strength, pick only those high-F-Score stocks that also had positive returns over the past year. The specifics can vary, but the unifying theme is a rule that says: *don’t just buy because it’s cheap; buy when it’s cheap **and** demand is starting to rise.* This dual requirement is entirely systematic (each stock either passes or fails the momentum threshold). The expected result is better performance and fewer “dead money” stocks. Indeed, Asness et al. famously found that a simple 50/50 blend of value and momentum factors dramatically improved Sharpe ratios relative to either strategy alone ([Using Momentum to Find Value -](https://alphaarchitect.com/2022/05/using-momentum-to-find-value/#:~:text=,The)) ([Using Momentum to Find Value -](https://alphaarchitect.com/2022/05/using-momentum-to-find-value/#:~:text=correlation%20averaged%20,fraction%20of%20the%20value%20and)).

By integrating momentum and technical heuristics, a value investor imposes structured discipline on *when* to enter positions. All these rules – whether it’s “above a moving average” or “top decile momentum” – are numeric filters that can be coded and backtested. They ensure the strategy remains systematic. In effect, momentum/technical rules help capitalize on the fact that markets often underreact *then* overreact: the value component exploits the initial underpricing, and the momentum component rides the subsequent correction in price.

## Backtested Strategies & Empirical Validation

Decades of data underscore the effectiveness of these quantitative value heuristics. Here we highlight backtested results from research and historical studies that validate the rules above:

 ([The chart that shows the past century has been about value investing, not growth | Trustnet](https://www.trustnet.com/news/13377987/the-chart-that-shows-the-past-century-has-been-about-value-investing-not-growth)) **Value vs. Growth Performance by Decade:** The chart above illustrates the long-term value premium. It shows average annual returns for U.S. stocks in each decade, comparing the lowest P/B (“value”) quintile (blue) versus the highest P/B (“growth”) quintile (orange). Value stocks outperformed in nearly every decade from the 1930s onward ([The chart that shows the past century has been about value investing, not growth | Trustnet](https://www.trustnet.com/news/13377987/the-chart-that-shows-the-past-century-has-been-about-value-investing-not-growth#:~:text=boom%27%20era%20of%201990s%20and,2010s%2C%20characterised%20by%20ultralow%20rates)). Over 1930–2020, low-P/B stocks earned about **5.22% more per year** than high-P/B stocks on average ([The chart that shows the past century has been about value investing, not growth | Trustnet](https://www.trustnet.com/news/13377987/the-chart-that-shows-the-past-century-has-been-about-value-investing-not-growth#:~:text=boom%27%20era%20of%201990s%20and,2010s%2C%20characterised%20by%20ultralow%20rates)). This consistent premium confirms that systematically buying cheap stocks has yielded superior returns in the long run.

- **Value Premium (High Minus Low):** Broad market studies (Fama-French) find a persistent value factor. Since 1927, U.S. value stocks have beaten growth stocks by roughly **4% per annum** on average ([When It’s Value vs. Growth, History Is on Value’s Side | Dimensional](https://www.dimensional.com/ca-en/insights/when-its-value-versus-growth-history-is-on-values-side#:~:text=While%20disappointing%20periods%20emerge%20from,1927%2C%20as%20Exhibit%201%20shows)) ([When It’s Value vs. Growth, History Is on Value’s Side | Dimensional](https://www.dimensional.com/ca-en/insights/when-its-value-versus-growth-history-is-on-values-side#:~:text=have%20often%20shown%20up%20quickly,1927%2C%20as%20Exhibit%201%20shows)). This premium has been observed across different markets and eras. It implies that a simple rule like “buy the cheapest X% of stocks” would have outperformed “buy the most expensive X%” by a substantial margin historically. Even after accounting for risks, the value effect remains significant in long-term data ([Formulaic Investing: Is It Effective?](https://alphaarchitect.com/2025/01/formulaic-investing/#:~:text=,lead%20in%20CAPM%20alpha%20and)).

- **Magic Formula Backtests:** Joel Greenblatt’s Magic Formula (which ranks by high ROIC and low EV/EBIT) has been extensively tested. In Greenblatt’s own study covering 1988–2004, a Magic Formula portfolio of 30 stocks earned about **30.8% annualized returns vs 12.4% for the S&P 500** ([Greenblatt's Magic Formula Strategy: Methodology, Backtest, Performance, Investment Returns - QuantifiedStrategies.com](https://www.quantifiedstrategies.com/the-magic-formula-strategy/#:~:text=To%20our%20knowledge%2C%20the%20first,in%2014%20of%20the%2017)). This is an enormous outperformance. Even when limited to large-cap stocks, the strategy showed ~22–23% annual returns (still ~10% above the market) ([The Magic of the Magic Formula - Stock Rover](https://www.stockrover.com/blog/stock-research/magic-formula-investing-strategy/#:~:text=Greenblatt%20backtests%20his%20model%20to,Okay)). Other researchers have confirmed its efficacy in different markets: for example, in Hong Kong (2001–2014) the formula beat the market by **6–15% per year** depending on company size ([Magic formula investing - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_formula_investing#:~:text=,2019%20shows)). A more recent study (2003–2015) found the Magic Formula returned **11.4% vs 8.7%** for the S&P 500 ([Magic formula investing - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_formula_investing#:~:text=,outperformance%20was)). These results validate the rule-based approach of buying top-ranked EY and ROIC stocks. They also highlight that patience is required (the formula can underperform for a few years at times ([Magic formula investing - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_formula_investing#:~:text=7%20,outperformance%20was))). Nonetheless, over multi-year periods the systematic application of Greenblatt’s rules delivered higher returns than the broad market in numerous tests.

- **Piotroski F-Score Performance:** Piotroski’s 2000 paper showed that screening on financial strength adds alpha. Among high book-to-market (cheap) stocks, those with F-Score 8–9 significantly outgained those with low F-Scores. Specifically, **high F-Score value stocks beat low F-Score value stocks by ~7.5% annually** in his 20-year backtest ([Joseph Piotroski: Separating Winners from Losers in Value Investing – Validea's Guru Investor Blog](https://blog.validea.com/joseph-piotroski-separating-winners-from-losers-in-value-investing/#:~:text=were%20remarkable,per%20year%20on%20average)). He also demonstrated that a strategy buying high F-Score, high book-to-market firms earned **13.4% yearly** versus 5.9% for low F-Score value firms – essentially boosting returns by selecting the fundamentally strongest cheap stocks ([Joseph Piotroski: Separating Winners from Losers in Value Investing](https://blog.validea.com/joseph-piotroski-separating-winners-from-losers-in-value-investing/#:~:text=A%20portfolio%20of%20high%20book,annually.%20Conversely%2C)) ([Value Investing Research: Simple Methods to Improve the Piotroski ...](https://alphaarchitect.com/2015/05/value-investing-research-simple-methods-to-improve-the-piotroski-f-score/#:~:text=This%20means%20that%20the%20high,Score%20value%20portfolio)). This is compelling evidence that a simple rule (e.g. “buy only if F-Score ≥ 8”) can enhance a classic value strategy. Subsequent research in various markets (e.g. Europe, Australia, China) also found the F-Score effective at improving performance and even as a short signal for weak companies.

- **Enterprise Multiple (EV/EBIT) Outperformance:** Quantitative value investors often favor the EV/EBIT metric due to strong empirical results. A 2011 study in European markets (1999–2011) found that stocks in the cheapest EV/EBIT quintile massively outperformed those in the most expensive quintile ([How and why to implement an EBIT to enterprise value investment strategy | Quant Investing](https://www.quant-investing.com/blog/how-and-why-to-implement-an-ebit-to-enterprise-value-investment-strategy#:~:text=Here%20are%20the%20back%20tested,1999%20to%2013%20June%202011)) ([How and why to implement an EBIT to enterprise value investment strategy | Quant Investing](https://www.quant-investing.com/blog/how-and-why-to-implement-an-ebit-to-enterprise-value-investment-strategy#:~:text=Q1%20,the%20most%20expensive)). The average returns for the cheapest group were many multiples higher (in one backtest, cheap EV/EBIT stocks returned ~198% cumulatively vs a –29% for expensive ones over 12 years) as indicated by the data. More generally, a comprehensive analysis (1963–2022) by Schwartz and Hanauer showed that **the Acquirer’s Multiple (EV/EBIT)** strategy had the highest top-decile returns among several formulaic approaches ([Formulaic Investing: Is It Effective?](https://alphaarchitect.com/2025/01/formulaic-investing/#:~:text=,lead%20in%20CAPM%20alpha%20and)). All valuation metrics they tested had monotonic gains (cheaper deciles outperforming expensive ones), but EV/EBIT stood out as delivering particularly strong raw returns ([Formulaic Investing: Is It Effective?](https://alphaarchitect.com/2025/01/formulaic-investing/#:~:text=%2A%20The%20top,lead%20in%20CAPM%20alpha%20and)) ([Formulaic Investing: Is It Effective?](https://alphaarchitect.com/2025/01/formulaic-investing/#:~:text=,lead%20in%20CAPM%20alpha%20and)). This confirms that a simple rule focusing on *earnings yield* is statistically sound. Investors implementing a rule like “buy the 50 cheapest stocks by EV/EBIT” have historically achieved market-beating results in many regions ([How and why to implement an EBIT to enterprise value investment strategy | Quant Investing](https://www.quant-investing.com/blog/how-and-why-to-implement-an-ebit-to-enterprise-value-investment-strategy#:~:text=Earnings%20before%20Interest%20and%20Taxes,give%20you%20the%20best%20returns)).

- **Momentum + Value Combination:** Empirical evidence also validates combining momentum with value. Asness et al. (2013) famously documented that value and momentum “work everywhere” – across asset classes and countries – and that a **50/50 combined portfolio improved Sharpe ratios significantly** ([Using Momentum to Find Value -](https://alphaarchitect.com/2022/05/using-momentum-to-find-value/#:~:text=,The)) ([Using Momentum to Find Value -](https://alphaarchitect.com/2022/05/using-momentum-to-find-value/#:~:text=correlation%20averaged%20,fraction%20of%20the%20value%20and)). One practical example: a strategy that bought the top 30% cheapest stocks *after* filtering for positive 12-month momentum greatly outperformed a pure value strategy in tests ([How and why to implement an EBIT to enterprise value investment strategy | Quant Investing](https://www.quant-investing.com/blog/how-and-why-to-implement-an-ebit-to-enterprise-value-investment-strategy#:~:text=How%20can%20I%20further%20enhance,EV%20strategy%20to%20improve%20returns)). Another study by Novy-Marx showed that adding a momentum rule can improve the consistency of value returns. For instance, an AQR Capital study found a value portfolio augmented with a momentum overlay produced higher risk-adjusted returns (alpha) than either factor alone ([Using Momentum to Find Value -](https://alphaarchitect.com/2022/05/using-momentum-to-find-value/#:~:text=,The)). These findings back up rules like “avoid the bottom momentum decile” or “require an upward trend” as described earlier. They result in empirically higher returns and lower drawdowns for systematic value strategies.

- **Decile Return Spreads:** In general, sorting stocks by value metrics produces *near-monotonic* return spreads in academic research. In one long-term study (1963–2022) that examined multiple formula-based strategies (Magic Formula, F-Score, EV/EBIT, etc.), **the spread between the cheapest decile and most expensive decile averaged around 5–6% per year in raw returns** ([Formulaic Investing: Is It Effective?](https://alphaarchitect.com/2025/01/formulaic-investing/#:~:text=,lead%20in%20CAPM%20alpha%20and)). Even on a risk-adjusted basis (CAPM alpha), the top-minus-bottom spread was sizeable (7–12% annually) ([Formulaic Investing: Is It Effective?](https://alphaarchitect.com/2025/01/formulaic-investing/#:~:text=,lead%20in%20CAPM%20alpha%20and)). This means an investor systematically buying value deciles and shorting growth deciles would have earned significant excess returns. While most individual investors only go long, these results reinforce that picking stocks from the **value end of the spectrum** (say top 10% cheapest by a metric) consistently beats picking from the **growth end**. Quantitatively, the cheap decile portfolios in these studies delivered higher average returns and alphas, validating the core premise of value heuristics.

To summarize the evidence: **Systematic value rules have worked historically.** Buying stocks that meet strict criteria (low P/E, low P/B, high yield, high F-Score, etc.) has yielded superior performance in many studies. The combination of rules – e.g. value + momentum or value + quality – often further improves outcomes, as documented by researchers and practitioners. While no strategy wins every year, the long-run data (spanning nearly a century and multiple markets) underscore that an investor following these quantitative heuristics would have beaten the market more often than not. Importantly, these results have been replicated out-of-sample, giving confidence that the rules are capturing genuine mispricings rather than just data-mining.

**Conclusion:** A purely systematic value investing approach is achievable by adhering to the kinds of rules outlined above. Investors can screen for **fundamental bargains (P/E, P/B, EV/EBIT thresholds)**, take cues from **market conditions (volatility, CAPE, yield spreads)**, and enforce **momentum/technical filters** to refine entry timing. Each rule is numeric and transparent – for example, *“Buy stocks with P/E < 12, EV/EBIT < 8, ROIC > 10%, only during high-volatility periods, and only if 6-month price momentum is positive.”* Such an algorithmic strategy, backed by extensive backtesting, removes emotion and exploits the statistical edge that value investing has demonstrated. By sticking to data-driven heuristics, investors can systematically capture the value premium and improve their odds of long-term outperformance ([Joseph Piotroski: Separating Winners from Losers in Value Investing – Validea's Guru Investor Blog](https://blog.validea.com/joseph-piotroski-separating-winners-from-losers-in-value-investing/#:~:text=were%20remarkable,per%20year%20on%20average)) ([Greenblatt's Magic Formula Strategy: Methodology, Backtest, Performance, Investment Returns - QuantifiedStrategies.com](https://www.quantifiedstrategies.com/the-magic-formula-strategy/#:~:text=To%20our%20knowledge%2C%20the%20first,in%2014%20of%20the%2017)), all while avoiding subjective biases. The end result is a disciplined, repeatable investment process squarely rooted in “buying low” with rules that have proven their merit in the marketplace.
