   Go to the [API Keys page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) once logged in.

3. **Generate a New API Key**  
   Click on **"Create new secret key"**. A new API key will be generated – copy it immediately as it will only be shown once.

4. **Implement Security Best Practices**  
   Keep your secret API key private. Use environment variables or secure storage methods in your application.

### 1.3 Financial Datasets API

Financial Datasets provides a developer-friendly stock market API with comprehensive market data. To obtain an API key:

1. **Create an Account**  
   Visit [Financial Datasets](https://www.financialdatasets.ai/) and sign up for a new developer account.

2. **Access Your Developer Dashboard**  
   Once registered and logged in, navigate to the API Keys section in your developer dashboard.

3. **Generate an API Key**  
   Follow the platform's instructions to generate a new API key for your project.

4. **Select Your Subscription Plan**  
   Choose the appropriate subscription plan based on your usage requirements. Financial Datasets typically offers tiered plans with varying data access levels and request limits.

5. **Store Your API Key Securely**  
   As with all API keys, ensure you store it securely in environment variables or a secure configuration system.

6. **Review Documentation and Limits**  
   Familiarise yourself with the API documentation, noting any rate limits or usage restrictions that may apply to your selected plan.

### 1.4 Tavily API

Tavily provides an AI-powered search API specializing in real-time web search and analysis. To get started:

1. **Create an Account**  
   Visit [Tavily](https://tavily.com/) and sign up for a new account.

2. **Get Your API Key**  
   - Navigate to your [API Keys Dashboard](https://tavily.com/dashboard)
   - Generate a new API key for your project
   - Copy and store your API key securely

3. **Choose Your Plan**  
   Select an appropriate plan based on your needs. Tavily offers:
   - Free tier for testing and development
   - Paid tiers for production use with higher rate limits

4. **Implement Security**  
   Store your API key securely using environment variables or secure configuration systems.

## 2. Alternatives to Using OpenAI

While OpenAI's API is popular, there are several alternative approaches that may better suit your needs in terms of cost, privacy, customisation and performance.

### 2.1 Local Solutions

#### Ollama

**Ollama** is a tool for running large language models locally on your own machine. This option is ideal if you require full data privacy and want to eliminate recurring API fees.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Data Privacy:** All processing is performed on your hardware.
- **Lower Latency:** Local inference can reduce response times.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Avoids ongoing subscription costs.
- **Multi-Platform Support:** Available for macOS, Linux and Windows.
- **Simple Management:** Easily download and run models with commands such as:
  - `ollama pull <model_name>` – to download a model.
  - `ollama run <model_name>` – to run the model locally.
- **Integration Options:** Offers a REST API and CLI for integration into web applications.

#### LocalAI and Other Self-Hosted Options

Other tools, such as **LocalAI** or frameworks integrated into systems like RAGFlow, enable you to host open-source language models on your infrastructure. This approach gives you:

- Full control over model behaviour and data.
- Greater customisation and the ability to fine-tune models to specific needs.
- Reduced long-term costs when compared to cloud services.

### 2.2 Cloud-Based Alternatives

If you prefer managed services or lack the necessary local hardware, consider these cloud-based providers:

- **Anthropic's Claude API:**  
  Offers advanced conversational and reasoning capabilities with robust safety features.
  
- **Cohere:**  
  Provides enterprise-grade large language models with flexible customisation and integration options.
  
- **AI21 Labs and NLP Cloud:**  
  Offer competitive text generation and NLP services at various price points.

Each of these services offers its own advantages in terms of ease of integration, scalability and support.
