### P/E

A popular valuation ratio of a company's current share price compared to its per-share earnings (trailing twelve months). Low P/E value indicates a stock is relatively cheap compared to its earnings. For instance, a P/E value of 15 means that the current price equals the sum of 15-year earnings per share. The average level varies across the market. Therefore, P/E value should be compared per sector or industry.

**P/E = Current Market Price / Earnings Per Share (EPS)**  
**P/E = Average Common Stock Price / Net Income Per Share**  
**EPS = (Net Income - Dividends On Preferred Stock) / Average Outstanding Shares**

### PEG

A ratio used to determine a stock's value while taking into account the earnings' growth. PEG is used to measure a stock's valuation (P/E) against its projected 3-5 year growth rate.
