# Erisfy – AI-Powered Stock Screening with Smarter Insights, Not Just Faster Decisions

## The Problem

Investors today face major challenges in making informed decisions:

- **Information Overload:** Traditional stock screeners flood users with raw data, forcing them to sift through noise instead of focusing on what truly matters.
- **Speed Over Strategy:** Most tools prioritize fast trade signals over thoughtful, well-reasoned investing, leading to surface-level analysis rather than strategic decision-making.
- **Lack of Explainable AI:** Many platforms generate alerts without context, failing to explain why a stock fits a strategy.
- **One-Size-Fits-All Screening:** Investors have diverse goals—whether value investing, growth strategies, or sector-specific focus—but most screeners don't adapt to individual priorities.
- **Disconnected Data Sources:** Investors constantly switch between multiple platforms to analyze fundamentals, sentiment, and technical indicators, leading to fragmented workflows.
