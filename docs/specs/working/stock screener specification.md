# Stock Screener Specification

## Overview

The mockups aim to visualize a user-friendly and intuitive interface for a next-generation stock screener. The design must simplify the process of selecting and combining filters while providing actionable insights and dynamic feedback. These mockups will focus on core screens, panels, and interactive features.
