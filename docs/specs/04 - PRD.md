**Primary Objective:** Develop an AI-powered stock screening and analysis platform that simplifies investment research while maintaining professional-grade depth.

**Key Deliverables:**

- A React-based single-page application (SPA) with real-time data visualization.
- An AI-driven screening engine that supports natural language queries and auto-configured stock screens.
- A backend API that integrates financial datasets and AI-based analysis.
- An intuitive user interface that balances accessibility and expert-level functionality.

### 2.2. Scope

**In-Scope:**

- AI-Driven Stock Screening: Users can filter stocks using AI-powered recommendations or manually configured filters.
- Natural Language Querying: A conversational search feature allows users to enter queries like, “Show me undervalued tech stocks with strong earnings growth.”
- Personalized Screening & Watchlists: Users receive tailored recommendations based on their investment style and history.
- Real-Time Market Data & AI Insights: Integration with financial datasets for live updates and AI-driven summaries.
- Portfolio Analysis & Risk Scoring: AI-generated insights on stock performance, risk assessment, and diversification strategies.

**Out-of-Scope:**

- Direct Trade Execution: Initially, the platform will focus on analysis rather than executing trades.
- High-Frequency Trading (HFT): The system is designed for strategic, well-reasoned investment decisions, not ultra-fast trading.
