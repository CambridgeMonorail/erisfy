# Technical Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction & High-Level Overview

Erisfy is an AI-powered financial market analysis tool that helps traders and investors identify opportunities using multi-agent reasoning. It integrates real-time data, orchestrates AI agents to provide actionable trade signals, and ensures human oversight with an interactive review and feedback loop.

## 2. System Architecture Overview

### 2.1 Frontend (User Interface)

**Framework:**

- React (or Next.js for server-side rendering) in TypeScript.

**Responsibilities:**

- **Dashboard & Visualization:** Render real-time charts, trade signals, and detailed agent reasoning.
- **User Interactions:** Enable operators to review, modify, and approve AI-generated trading decisions.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Utilize WebSockets (or alternative event-driven architecture) to deliver live updates.

**Managed Hosting Options:**

- Vercel or Netlify for seamless deployments, auto-scaling, and GitHub integration.

**Outstanding Questions:**

- Should we use GraphQL subscriptions instead of WebSockets for real-time updates?
- How do we handle UI performance optimizations for high-frequency real-time updates?

### 2.2 Middleware / Agent Orchestration (LangChain.js Layer)

**Framework:**

- LangChain.js in TypeScript.

**Responsibilities:**

- **Agent Coordination:** Orchestrates specialized agents (technical, fundamental, sentiment analysis, etc.) using a chain-based modular design.
- **Workflow Management:** Maintains conversation context and multi-step decision-making processes.
- **External Integration:** Fetches data from financial APIs and issues simulated (or live) trading commands.

**Persistent Memory Considerations:**

- Use Redis or a vector database (e.g., Pinecone) for storing agent context and past decisions.

**Managed Hosting Options:**

- Heroku or Render for easy Node.js deployments.
- DigitalOcean App Platform or AWS Lightsail for additional control.

**Outstanding Questions:**

- Do we need a stateful agent memory to track decision history over time?
- What is the best strategy for handling long-running asynchronous agent workflows?
- How do we explain agent decisions in a human-readable format?

### 2.3 Backend (API Gateway and Data Management)

**Environment:**

- Node.js with Express (or Next.js API routes) in TypeScript.

**Responsibilities:**

- **API Gateway:** Exposes RESTful or GraphQL endpoints for the frontend.
- **Data Persistence:** Logs trading data, historical market information, and human decision feedback using a managed database.
- **Security:** Enforces authentication (using JWT or OAuth) and secures API endpoints.
- **Integration:** Bridges the frontend, LangChain.js orchestration, and external APIs.

**Data Pipeline & Storage Strategy:**

- PostgreSQL (Heroku Postgres) for structured trading data.
- MongoDB Atlas for AI-generated insights and unstructured metadata.
- Kafka or Redis Streams for real-time market data processing.

**Outstanding Questions:**

- Should we use GraphQL instead of REST for API interactions?
- What are the storage and retention policies for historical AI decisions?
- How do we handle rate limits and API throttling for external data providers?

### 2.4 External Data & Broker Integration

**Data Providers:**

- Financial Data APIs supply market data for analysis.
- Primary data provider: Financial Datasets (selected for affordability and reliability).

**Broker APIs:**

- Optional integrations (e.g., Alpaca, Interactive Brokers) for executing trades (initially simulated).

**Role in Architecture:**

- The LangChain.js layer pulls real-time data and feeds it into agent modules.
- The backend facilitates communication between external services and internal workflows.

**Future Considerations:**

- News sentiment analysis APIs (Alpha Vantage, Bloomberg NLP, etc.).
- Alternative data sources (ESG ratings, Reddit sentiment, macroeconomic indicators).
- User-uploaded data (CSV, Google Sheets, custom API feeds).

**Outstanding Questions:**

- How do we handle data quality and verification for multiple data sources?
- Should we cache financial data to reduce API costs?

### 2.5 Human-in-the-Loop Interaction

**Operator Controls:**

- The React frontend provides interfaces for human operators to review AI-generated suggestions, override signals, and trigger backtests.

**Feedback Loop:**

- Operator inputs are fed back to the LangChain.js layer to adjust agent workflows.
- All decisions and human modifications are logged in the backend.

**Audit Trail:**

- Managed databases record every human interaction to ensure compliance and support continuous improvement.

**Outstanding Questions:**

- How do we structure explainability logs for AI-generated trading decisions?
- Should human overrides be prioritized in future AI predictions?

## 3. Hosting & Scalability Strategy

**Early-Stage Hosting (Development & MVP):**

- Heroku (Node.js), Render (LangChain.js), Vercel (Frontend) for ease of deployment.

**Growth-Stage Scalability Plan:**

- Move backend services to Kubernetes (AWS EKS or Google Kubernetes Engine) as traffic scales.
- Serverless execution (AWS Lambda) for burstable workloads (e.g., infrequent but intensive AI queries).
- Auto-scaling WebSockets for real-time updates with load balancing.

**Outstanding Questions:**

- Should we use serverless or containerized architecture for long-term scalability?
- How do we manage multi-region deployment for low-latency trading execution?

## 5. Summary & Next Steps

This document outlines the technical foundation for Erisfy. Outstanding questions remain in:

- Data caching & API optimization
- GraphQL vs REST considerations
- Agent explainability & decision transparency
- Long-term scalability choices (serverless vs containers)

Next, we should conduct internal discussions and feasibility tests on these areas before finalizing implementation strategies.
