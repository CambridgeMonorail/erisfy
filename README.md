## Overview

Erisfy is an AI-powered stock screener that simplifies investing by transforming raw market data into clear, actionable insights, enabling investors to discover opportunities, analyze trends, and make confident decisions faster. The project aims to integrate Large Language Models (LLM) and Agentic AI into modern TypeScript-based web products. The project is in its early alpha stage and is a work in progress. The goal is to learn by doing, creating a functional application that showcases the potential of LLM and Agentic AI in FinTech.

## Project Goals

- **Simplified Setup**: Provide a ready-to-use boilerplate for developers looking to build SPAs using modern tools without SSR or Next.js.
- **Seamless Integration**: Combine Nx for monorepo management, Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, and Shadcn UI for cohesive, customizable UI components.
- **Scalability and Modularity**: Offer a scalable architecture with reusable libraries and clear boundaries between projects.
- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Deliver a well-documented, intuitive, and maintainable codebase to boost productivity and reduce onboarding time.
- **Community Collaboration**: Foster an open-source community to innovate, improve, and expand the project.
- **Experimentation**: Explore and test new UI/UX concepts and design patterns for FinTech applications.

For a detailed breakdown of the project goals, see [Project Goals](./docs/project-goals.md).

## Features

- üèó **Nx Monorepo**: Modular and scalable workspace for managing multiple projects and libraries.
- üé® **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive UI development.
- üñå **Shadcn UI**: A customizable component library for consistent and reusable design patterns.
- ‚ö° **Vite**: Fast and efficient development server and build tool.
- üöÄ **CI/CD Integration**: Preconfigured workflows for automated builds and testing.

## Why This Project Was Built

While tools like Nx, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI are incredibly powerful and offer numerous benefits for modern front-end development, the process of configuring them can still be time-consuming, error-prone, and frustrating, even for experienced developers. This is because setting up such architectures from scratch is an infrequent task, and each setup can have its own unique challenges and nuances.

This project was built to address these challenges by providing a pre-configured, ready-to-use boilerplate that simplifies the initial setup process. By leveraging this boilerplate, developers can quickly start building their applications without worrying about the complexities of configuration, allowing them to focus on writing code and delivering features.

For more details on why a React SPA boilerplate may still have some value in a Next.js world, see [Why a React SPA Boilerplate in a Next.js World?](./docs/why-spa-why.md)

To learn how to theme your app using Shadcn UI and Tailwind CSS, please refer to the detailed guide in [docs/theming-a-new-app.md](./docs/theming-a-new-app.md).

**Note:** The current theme was generated using the Ready.js [Shadcn UI Theme Generator](https://www.readyjs.dev/tools/shadcn-ui-theme-generator).

### Adding a New Component Page to the Routing in Your React SPA

To add a new component page to the routing in your React SPA, please refer to the detailed guide in [docs/adding-new-component-page.md](./docs/adding-new-component-page.md).

## Enabling/Disabling API Mocks

To enable or disable API mocks, follow these steps:

1. Open the `.env` file in the `apps/client` directory.
2. Set the `VITE_REACT_APP_USE_MOCKS` environment variable to `true` to enable mocks or `false` to disable them.

```ini
VITE_REACT_APP_USE_MOCKS=true
```

## Running Tests with MSW

To run tests with MSW, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the mock server is set up in the `apps/client/src/mocks/server.ts` file.
2. Import and start the mock server in your test setup file (`apps/client/src/test/setup.ts`).

```typescript
import { server } from '../mocks/server';

beforeAll(() => server.listen());
afterEach(() => server.resetHandlers());
afterAll(() => server.close());
```

3. Write your tests as usual, and MSW will intercept the API requests and return the mock responses.

## Reference Documentation

For detailed steps on setting up MSW and integrating API mocking in Erisfy, refer to the [Integrating API Mocking with MSW in Erisfy](./docs/specs/working/Integrating%20API%20Mocking%20with%20MSW%20in%20Erisfy.md) documentation.
